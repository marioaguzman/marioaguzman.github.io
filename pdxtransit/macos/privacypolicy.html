					<p>Your privacy is important to us so we’ve developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your personal and non-personal information. In addition to this Privacy Policy, we provide data and privacy information imbedded in our products for certain features. Please refer to the Help menu in PDX Transit for macOS.</p>
					<p>Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and contact us if you have any questions.</p>
					
					<p><b>Collection and Use of Personal Information</b></p>
					<p>Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person. Here are some examples of the types of information PDX Transit may collect and how it may be used:</p>
					
					<p><b>What non-personal information we collect</b></p>
					<p>PDX Transit uses your current location. You may decline to share your current location with PDX Transit however, overall capability of PDX Transit will be limited.</p>
					<p>PDX Transit uses your iCloud account. You may decline to share your iCloud account storage with PDX Transit however, overall capability of PDX Transit will be limited. Trimet transit stops can be saved (Bookmarked) for quicker access to arrival times later. These Bookmarks are stored on your iCloud account private storage so they are available on all your devices.</p>
					
					<p><b>How we use your non-personal information</b></p>
					<p>PDX Transit uses your location in order to determine nearby Trimet transit stops. Your current location coordinates are sent to the Trimet Open Data Service API in order to retrieve nearby transit stops within a one mile radius. PDX Transit does not store, track, or keep a history of your current location.</p>
					<p>PDX Transit uses your iCloud Drive in order to store (Bookmark) Trimet transit stops of interest. PDX Transit will store the following pieces of information with each Bookmark: Trimet Transit Stop ID, Trimet Transit Stop Description, Trimet Transit Stop Direction, Trimet Transit Stop Coordinates Latitude, Trimet Transit Stop Coordinates Longitude, Trimet Transit Stop No-Service Flag, Trimet Transit Stop Passenger Code. Each of these fields comes directly from the Trimet Open Data Service API. The last field that is stored is a custom and optional user description field and is the only field that does not come directly from the Trimet Oepn Data Service API.</p>
					<p>Having access (if granted) to the user's iCloud Drive, it is important to note that PDX Transit does not have access to your Apple ID, name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP address, location information, credit card information, or data created & stored by other apps.</p>
					<p>PDX Transit stores Bookmarks on iCloud in order to make them available on all devices that are logged into the same iCloud account and that have PDX Transit installed. This includes iOS, watchOS, and macOS devices.</p>
					
					<p><b>Location Services</b></p>
					<p>PDX Transit uses your current location. You may decline to share your current location with PDX Transit however, overall capability of PDX Transit will be limited. PDX Transit will attain precise location data including the real-time geographic location of your Apple computer or device. Where available, location-based services may use GPS, Bluetooth, and your IP Address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations, and other technologies to determine your devices’ approximate location. Unless you provide consent, this location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you.</p>
					
					<p><b>3rd Party Services</b></p>
					<p>PDX Transit uses the Trimet Open Data API in order to determine nearby transit stops. The only piece of information that is sent to this service is your current location coordinates. Personal information is not sent to the 3rd Party Service (Trimet).</p>
